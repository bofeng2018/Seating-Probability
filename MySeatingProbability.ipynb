    "# Problem Description\n",
    "**There are *n* passengers waiting to be seated in a plane with *n* seats**. Both passengers and seats are assigned IDs from 1 to *n*. Passengers will be seated one by one in the order of increasing IDs. Ideally, all passengers will be seated in their assigned seats. For simplicity, we can assume that the *ith* passenger should be seated in the *ith* seat according to the tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes the things complicated is that the first passenger with ID 1 lost the ticket and can only pick a random seat to sit on. All other passengers are so kind such that if they find their assigend seats taken, they will not ask people to leave. Instead, they will also randomly pick another empty seat to sit on. The pilot is a probability lover and wants to calculate the probability that the last *k* passengers will all be seated in their assigned seats. **It is guaranteed that *k* is a positive integer less than *n***. Notice that, theoretically, it is possible that all the *n* passengers sit on assigned seats such that *k* should be allowed to be equal to *n*. However, it is exactly the same as the case where *k* is equal to *n*-1, because if the last *n-1* passengers sit on the correct seats, the first passenger must be seated correctly as well. Thus, the case of *k* equal to *n* is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you help the pilot get the problem resolved?"

    "# Incorrect Solution\n",
    "There could be many solutions for the problem. Below is one of them trying to tackle the problem by calculating the total numbers of valid seating combinations and ones among them that satisfy the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before presenting the solution, there are some important facts to lay out. **Firstly, for all passengers other than the first passenger who has lost the ticket, they will always sit on their assigned seats if not already taken. Secondly, all passengers will never sit on a seat with a smaller ID unless it is the seat 1.** The second fact can be automatically justified using the first fact. Let's use an example with 10 passengers and seats. Assume the first passenger randomly picks the seat 6. As a result, passengers from 2 to 5 will not find their seats taken and will always be seated in their assigned seats. When it comes to the passenger 6, the available seats are seats 7 to 10 as well as the seat 1. If the passenger 6 takes the seat 1, it is obvious that all the rest passengers will all be seated in their assigned seats. If the passenger 6 takes the seat 7, the passenger 7 will find the corresponding situation to be almost the same as the passenger 6, where the available seats are the ones from 8 to 10 as well as the seat 1. If the passenger 6 takes any seat with an ID larger than 7 such as the seat 9, the only difference will be that all passengers between IDs 6 and 9, i.e. 7 and 8, will always be seated in the assigned seats, while it is the passenger 9 that will face a similar situation as the passenger 6. Thus, the second fact is proved.\n",
    "\n",
    "After understanding the two facts in the last paragraph, the patterns of valid seating permutations are easy to describe. Assume the array *arr* saves the IDs of the passengers not sitting on their assigned seats in an increasing order. **Then, *arr* will be valid if and only if the first element is always 1 and for any ID in *arr* except the last one, the passenger with the ID sits on the seat with an ID that is exactly the next element in *arr*, while the passenger with the last ID in *arr* is seated in the seat 1.** All passengers with IDs not in *arr* should be seated in their assigned seats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a result, if we know the IDs of the passengers who do not sit on their assigned seats, there is one and only one seating scenario that is valid. Thus, we only need to consider the number of ID combinations of passengers who sit on incorrect seats from IDs 2 to *n***.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total number of valid seating =** $\\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} {n - 1 \\choose i} = 2^{n - 1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total number of valid seating with last k passengers seating in assigned seats =** $\\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1 - k} {n - 1 \\choose i} = 2^{n - 1 - k}$.\n",
    "* **Probability of last k passengers seating in assigned seats =** $\\dfrac{2^{n - 1 - k}}{2^{n - 1}}=2^{-k}$."

    "# Correct Solution\n",
    "Although the solution above looks temptingly elegant, it is incorrect. The calculation of total numbers of valid seating and ones with last k passengers seating in assigned seats is absolutely correct. **What makes the probability wrong is that each valid seating does not always have the same probability to appear.** Using *n* = 3 as an example, the probability of *arr* = \\[1, 2, 3\\] is 1 / 3, while the probability of *arr* = \\[2, 3, 1\\] is 1 / 6, although both are valid seating scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the correct solution, we can use the mathematical induction method. Based on a few experiments, it seems that for any valid combination of *(n, k)*, the probability of last *k* passengers seating in assigned seats is always 1 / (*k* + 1). Now we need to prove it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Base Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "When *n* = *k* + 1, it is obvious that for the last *k* passengers to be seated correctly, the first passenger can only sit on the first seat. Thus, the probability is shown below.\n",
    "* $p=\\dfrac{1}{n}=\\dfrac{1}{k + 1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Induction Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "If for all *n* from *k* + 1 to *m*, the probability above always holds. Then, we need to prove that, for the case of *n* = *m* + 1, the same formula still holds. In the case when the first passenger sits on the first seat, the last *k* passengers will be seated correctly and the corresponding probability is 1 / (*n* + 1). If instead the first passenger sits on the second seat, the rest of the problem is then to calculate the probability for the case when *n* = *m*. One might argue those two cases are different because in the true case of *n* = *m*, the first passenger can sit on the true first seat, but not in this case. However, the second passenger or the pseudo-first passenger, can possibly pick the true first seat, and the rest are exactly the same for both cases. Thus, for the case that the first passenger picks the second seat, the probability of the last *k* passengers seated correctly is \\[1 / (*n* + 1)\\] * \\[1 / (*k* + 1) \\]. It can be easily seen that *n* - *k* is the largest ID of seats that the first passenger can pick which still makes it possible to have the last *k* passengers seated correctly, and for any seat ID between 2 and *n* - *k* that the first passenger picks, the probability of the last *k* passengers seated correctly is \\[1 / (*n* + 1)\\] * \\[1 / (*k* + 1) \\]. Thus, the overall probability for the case of *n* = *m* + 1 can be calculated as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $p=\\dfrac{1}{n} * [1 + \\dfrac{1}{k + 1} * (n - k - 1)] = \\dfrac{1}{n} * \\dfrac{n}{k + 1} = \\dfrac{1}{k + 1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, with both the base case and the induction step, it is proved that the probability of last *k* passengers seating in assigned seats is always 1 / (*k* + 1)."
